# TicTacToeFX

It is a classic TicTacToe game with AI player and implementation of Memento pattern.

As Wikipedia tells:

> The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.

In my case, I used it to undo the last turn. This was done in August 2016.
